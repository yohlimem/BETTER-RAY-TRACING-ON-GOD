# This is a ray tracing algorithm
This is a cool ray tracing algorithm that uses vectors to bounce rays from lines and spheres.

# Snell's law
Snell's law is also applied. Truly amazing I know. The water medium has n=1.5 and the normal air medium has n=1

# I KNOW THIS IS VERY COOL SO JUST GO PLAY WITH IT.
